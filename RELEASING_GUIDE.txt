Preliminaries
-------------

* Ensure that `RELEASE_NOTES.rst` has up-to-date release notes.

* Ensure that there are no branches in the version in `setup.py`.

* Check the test results from Appveyor and TravisCI.

* Push any latest changes.

Release
-------

* Create a new tag for the given version

    git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Tagging version X.Y.Z"

* Push the tag to Github:

    git push
    git push --tags

Package and upload
------------------

Build a source distribution and a wheel for Windows and the latest Python version
as:

    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel 
    twine upload --repository pypi dist/mrcz*

To build the `conda-forge` recipe first copy the SHA hash from the latest release
`mrcz-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` on pypi:

    https://pypi.org/project/mrcz/

Then in the `staged-recipes` git repo you need to modify `recipe/meta.yml`
to:
    - Bump the version 
    - Paste in the new SHA hash

Finally
-------

* Increment the version enumerator in `setup.py` and push.
